'''A triple (洧논,洧녽,洧녾) of integers is called Pythagorean if 洧논2+洧녽2=洧녾2. For example, (3,4,5) is a Pythagorean triple because 32+42=52.

Study the function pythagoreans(n) explored in the lectures that returns a list of Pythagorean triples (洧논,洧녽,洧녾) such that 洧논, 洧녽 and 洧녾 are in the range of 1 and n. Write a new version of this function pythagoreans(a, b) that:
1. returns a list of triples where all components are between a and b
2. only returns unique Pythagorean triples, namely the smallest one according to the lexicographical order. For instance, (3,4,5) should be returned but not (4,3,5);
You can use comprehensions but not loops. You cannot use functions sort() or sorted().
